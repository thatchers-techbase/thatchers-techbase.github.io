							<h2>BEFORE YOU BEGIN!</h2>
							<p>
								<b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> is a game mod that uses the classic video game <i>DOOM 2 (1994)</i> as a base. As such, a copy of the file 'DOOM2.wad' is required in order to play. 
								<br><br>
								Legally, I am not allowed to give you that file. I don't want to get sued - Bethesda has access to Robert Trump's $66.6 million legal team, and I do not! You'll need to find it yourself. Consider it part of the gameplay experience!
								<br><br>
								If you cannot find DOOM2.wad anywhere in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/2020_03_22_DOOM">archives of the internet</a>, then you can always buy DOOM 2 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/DOOM_II/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/doom_ii_final_doom?gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2tCGBhCLARIsABJGmZ50epeIFI3DdvrlMztVqyJzL8lSKJVlhaRxOGP9K_X1l1aTkqJ-gfYaAtLgEALw_wcB">GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/doom-ii-classic/9plt62lrf9v7?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">the Microsoft Store</a> - these versions of the game contain the file you'll need. Got Microsoft Game Pass? You could 'borrow' the file from its installation directory! Is that legal? I'm not sure!
								<br><br>
								<a href="file/THATCHER.wad"><img src="images/THATCHERWAD.png" class="wad-pic"></a>
								<a href="file/THATCHER.wad">THATCHER.wad</a>, the other file you'll need, is completely free to download! You can get it by clicking on the link or icon on this page.
								<br></br> 
								Once you have acquired a copy of DOOM2.wad and a copy of THATCHER.wad, think carefully about what operating system you use and proceed to the appropriate next step...

								<h3>AN OLD-SCHOOL EXPERIENCE?</h3><br>
								Want to play <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> like it's 1994, and have it run on almost any computer¹? 
								<br><br>

								<p align="center">
								I recommend downloading <a href="">this</a>:
								<br><br>

								<a href="file/THATCHER.wad"><img src="images/THATCHERZIP.png" style="width: 15%"></a>
								<br><br></p>

								Once you've downloaded THATCHER.ZIP, extract it to a folder and open it up. Then add DOOM2.wad and THATCHER.wad to the folder...
								<br><br>

								<img src="images/windows-step1.png" style="width:90%">
								<br><br>

								And double-click on THATCHER.bat in the same folder to run the game! Easy!
								<br><br> 

								<img src="images/windows-step2.png" style="width:80%">
								<br><br>

								Stuck on the splash screen? Try hitting the <code>ESC</code> key!
								<br><br>

								<h3>NEW-AGE ACTION! (FOR WINDOWS XP USERS AND ABOVE)</h3><hr><br>
								
								Lucky enough to own a computer or laptop that can run Windows XP (or above), and want a more user-friendly port of DOOM? You can grab <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom</a> or <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">ZDoom</a>, a source port that supports the latest mods and wads and lets you use <b>your very own gamepad</b>!
								<br><br>
								
								Once you've downloaded G/ZDoom, extract the folder and add your DOOM2.wad and THATCHER.wad files to the directory, just as above, and then double-click THATCHER.wad (or drag it onto gzdoom.exe) to play! Have fun!
								<br><br>

								<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hdv1jxX.png" style="float:right; width:30%; margin-left:5%; margin-bottom: 4%;"></a>

								<b>BEWARE!</b> By default, GZDoom enables features like texture filtering, fully-3D aiming and a scaled HUD - things that weren't a part of the original DOOM experience. If you wanna play like that, it's no problem! But do be aware that you may need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JC8fnz_L3k">some tinkering</a> of your new GZDoom installation to make it nice and crispy.

							<h2>Mac OS, OS X</h2>
							<hr><br>
							<p>
								If you'd like to play <b>THATCHER' TECHBASE</b> on OS X, download <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom</a>! 
								<br><br>

								(For people on <i>really</i> old versions of OS X, you can still play the game using <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">ZDoom</a> - it's available on the same webpage!)
								<br><br>
								
								Once you've downloaded and installed G/ZDoom, you'll probably get a message that looks like this:
								<br><br>
								
								<img src="images/osx-step1.png">
								<br><br>

								To fix this, open up your <i>Library -> Application Support</i> folder in OS X:
								<br><br>

								<img src="images/osx-step2.png">
								<br><br>

								Open up the <i>gzdoom</i> folder inside <i>Application Support</i>, and then drag your <b>DOOM2.WAD</b> file into the folder: 
								<br><br>

								<img src="images/osx-step3.png">
								<br><br>

								Almost there! Now that you're ready to go, just locate <a href="file/THATCHER.WAD"</a>THATCHER.WAD</a> and double-click it to run <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b>! 
								<br><br>

								<img src="images/osx-step4.png">
								<br><br>

								Have fun!

							<h2 >LINUX</h2>
							<hr>
							<p>
								Seriously?
								<br><br>

								If you'd like to play <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> on Linux, you can install <a href="http://prboom.sourceforge.net/linux.html">PRBoom for Linux and UNIX Systems</a>, <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom for Ubuntu</a>, or compile it directly from <a href="https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom/archive/g4.6.0.zip">the source code</a>.
								<br><br>

								<h3>PRBoom</h3>

								To run <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> with PRBoom, use the following command:
								<br><br>

								<code>prboom -iwad DOOM2.wad -file THATCHER.wad</code>
								<br><br>

								<h3>GZDoom</h3>
								For GZDoom, the OS X instructions should apply... but I don't really know! If you are using Linux, you probably know about computers than I do and do not need my help!
