                  <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> is a game mod that uses the classic
                  video game <i>DOOM 2 (1994)</i> as a base. As such, a copy of
                  the file 'DOOM2.wad' is required in order to play.
                  <br /><br />
                  Legally, I am not allowed to give you that file. I don't want
                  to get sued - Bethesda has access to Robert Trump's $66.6
                  million legal team, and 3D: Doom Daddy Digital does not!
                  <br /><br />
                  If you own a copy of Doom 2 for MS-DOS, Windows, Mac OS, Sega
                  Saturn, Game Boy Advance, Tapwave Zodiac, N-Gage, Android,
                  iOS, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X,
                  Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 or
                  PlayStation 5, then you legally have a license for the file
                  'doom2.wad' - but you'll need to find a copy of it yourself.
                  Consider it part of the gameplay experience!
                  <br /><br />
                  If you cannot find DOOM2.wad anywhere in the
                  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2020_03_22_DOOM"
                    >archives of the internet</a
                  >, then you can always buy DOOM 2 again on

                  Microsoft Game Pass? You could 'borrow' the file from its
                  installation directory! Is that legal? I'm not sure!

                <br />
                Want to play <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> like it's 1994, and have
                it run on almost any computer¹? Happy to play with a keyboard
                and mouse? <br /><br />
                I recommend downloading
                <a href="file/THATCHERCADE.zip">this</a>. Once you've downloaded
                THATCHERCADE.ZIP, extract it to a folder and open it up. Then
                add DOOM2.wad and THATCHER.wad to the folder...
                <br /><br /><br /><br />
                <img src="images/windows-step1.png" style="width: 90%" />
                <br /><br /><br /><br />
                And double-click on THATCHER.bat in the same folder to run the
                game! Easy!
                <br /><br />
                <img src="images/windows-step2.png" style="width: 80%" />
                <br /><br /><br /><br />
                ❗❗❗ Stuck on the splash screen? Try hitting the
                <code>ESC</code> key! <br /><br />

                <br /><br /><br /><br />
                Now you're all good to go! Enjoy <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b>, and

                Lucky enough to own a computer or laptop that can run Windows XP
                (or above) and want a more user-friendly port of DOOM? You can
                grab <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom</a> or
                <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">ZDoom</a>, a source port
                that supports the latest mods and wads and lets you use
                <b>your very own gamepad</b>! <br /><br />
                Once you've downloaded G/ZDoom, extract the folder and add your
                DOOM2.wad and THATCHERCADE.wad files to the directory, just as
                above, and then double-click THATCHERCADE.wad (or drag it onto
                gzdoom.exe) to play! Have fun!
                <br /><br />

                <b>BEWARE!</b> By default, GZDoom enables features like texture
                filtering, fully-3D aiming and a scaled HUD - things that
                weren't a part of the original DOOM experience. If you wanna
                play like that, it's no problem! But do be aware that you may
                need to

                <p>
                  If you'd like to play <b>THATCHER' TECHBASE</b> on OS X,
                  download <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">GZDoom</a>!

                  (For people on <i>really</i> old versions of OS X, you can
                  still play the game using
                  <a href="https://zdoom.org/downloads">ZDoom</a> - it's
                  available on the same webpage!) <br /><br />
                  Once you've downloaded and installed G/ZDoom, you'll probably
                  get a message that looks like this:

                  <img src="images/osx-step1.png" />
                  <br /><br />
                  To fix this, open up your
                  <i>Library -> Application Support</i> folder in OS X:
                  <br /><br />
                  <img src="images/osx-step2.png" />
                  <br /><br />
                  Open up the <i>gzdoom</i> folder* inside
                  <i>Application Support</i>, and then drag your
                  <b>DOOM2.WAD</b> file into the folder: <br /><br />
                  <img src="images/osx-step3.png" />
                  <br /><br />
                  Almost there! Now that you're ready to go, just locate
                  <a href="file/THATCHERCADE.wad">THATCHERCADE.wad</a> and
                  double-click it to run <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b>!
                  <br /><br />
                  <img src="images/osx-step4.png" />
                  <br /><br />
                  Have fun!
                  <br /><br />
                  * Can't find a 'GZDoom' folder in Application Support? If you
                  create it yourself and put DOOM2.WAD in there, GZDoom should
                  be able to find it.

                To run <b>THATCHER'S TECHBASE</b> with PRBoom, use the following

                <code>prboom -iwad DOOM2.wad -file THATCHERCADE.wad</code>

                For GZDoom, the OS X instructions should apply... but I don't
                really know! If you are using Linux, you probably know about
                computers than I do and do not need my help!

                <p>
                  The easiest way to play THATCHER'S TECHBASE on an Android
                  phone or tablet is by getting
                  <a
                    href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opentouchgaming.deltatouch&hl=en&gl=US"
                    >Delta Touch</a
                  >
                  from the Google Play Store. It's £/$2.49, but well worth the
                  investment. You'll be supporting a great app, a great
                  developer, and will gain the ability to play countless Doom
                  mods and wads from the past 28 years. <br /><br />
                  Once installed on your device, all you need to do is grab your
                  copy of the Doom2.wad and stick it in the "OpenTouch/Delta"
                  folder on your device's storage. Your copy of
                  <a href="file/THATCHERCADE.wad">THATCHERCADE.wad</a> goes in
                  the "OpenTouch/Delta/Mods" folder. <br /><br />
                  Once you've done that, open Delta Touch on your Android device
                  and click on "DOOM2.WAD". Press the keyboard icon in the
                  bottom-right corner of the screen, choose the list icon, and
                  select THATCHERCADE.wad - from now on, clicking on Doom2.wad
                  will launch THATCHER'S TECHBASE!

                <hr />
                <p>
                  One of the coolest things about Doom is that it can run on
                  anything.<br /><br />
                  THATCHER'S TECHBASE can't run on anything.<br /><br />
                  I did a pretty crappy job of making it - but it can run on a
                  lot of things. As a Boom-compatible Doom WAD, Thatcher's
                  Techbase should be runnable on any console that has
                  Boom-compatible source port, such as the Wii U, Nintendo DS,
                  PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita. Just stick "(device)
                  prboom port" into Google and you may be pleasantly
                  surprised!<br /><br />
                  Please let me know if you get the game running on anything
                  interesting, or are having issues getting it working. I'm
                  happy to help.
